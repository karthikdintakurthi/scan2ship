## üéØ CONCLUSION

The Scan2Ship application currently has **ZERO test coverage**, which represents a **CRITICAL security risk**. All security implementations, including password validation, session management, input sanitization, and authentication, are completely untested.

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Jest configuration** to enable test execution
2. **Implement security tests** for all critical modules
3. **Set up test infrastructure** for comprehensive coverage
4. **Establish testing standards** for ongoing development

### Risk Assessment:
- **Current Risk Level:** CRITICAL üö®
- **Security Risk:** HIGH
- **Business Risk:** HIGH
- **Compliance Risk:** HIGH

**The application is NOT production-ready without comprehensive test coverage, especially for security-critical components.**
